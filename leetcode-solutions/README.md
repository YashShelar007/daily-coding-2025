# LeetCode Solutions Collection

Welcome to the **LeetCode Solutions** repositoryâ€”a curated collection of algorithm solutions derived from popular problem sets like [Neetcode150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) and [Top Interview 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/).

## Overview

This folder contains pure algorithm implementations that serve as:
- **Practice:** Sharpen your problem-solving skills.
- **Documentation:** Learn various approaches to classic problems.
- **Benchmarking:** Compare performance and analyze time/space complexities.

Each challenge is organized in its own subdirectory (e.g., `two-sum`, `valid-parentheses`, etc.), and every challenge includes:
- A Python solution.
- Test cases (in JSON-lines format).
- A test runner script for local validation.
- A detailed README explaining the problem, approach, and usage instructions.

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to a Challenge Folder:**  
   For example, to work on the Two Sum problem:
   ```bash
   cd leetcode-solutions/two-sum
   ```

2. **Run the Tests Locally:**  
   Execute the test runner to validate the solution:
   ```bash
   python test_runner.py
   ```

3. **Review the Code & Documentation:**  
   Each challenge folder contains its own README with an in-depth explanation of the problem and the chosen approach.

## Contribution

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute by suggesting improvements or additional test cases. Use clear commit messages with tags such as `#leetcode` to indicate algorithm updates.

Happy coding!
