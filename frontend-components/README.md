# Front-End Components

Welcome to the **Front-End Components** section of our daily coding challenge monorepo! Here, you’ll find individual front-end projects—typically built with React—that showcase and visualize solutions to various algorithmic problems in a user-friendly way.

## Overview

Each subfolder in this directory contains a **self-contained front-end project**. For instance:
- **`bracket-matcher/`**: A React app demonstrating real-time validation for the “Valid Parentheses” problem.

These projects often integrate the logic from our **`leetcode-solutions`** directory to bring algorithmic solutions to life with interactive UIs.

## Goals & Motivations

1. **Visual Demonstrations**:  
   Turning abstract coding challenges into interactive demos helps deepen understanding and engages users.

2. **Front-End Skill Development**:  
   Each project may explore different frameworks or libraries (React, Vue, etc.), styling approaches, and build tools (Webpack, Vite, Create React App, etc.).

3. **Reusable Components**:  
   Some projects might produce components that can be embedded elsewhere (e.g., a bracket validation widget in a larger app).

4. **Best Practices**:  
   - Clear folder structure and naming conventions.  
   - Minimal, easy-to-run setups (just `npm install` and `npm start`).  
   - Well-documented READMEs detailing how each project works.

## Folder Structure

```
frontend-components/
├── bracket-matcher/
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── App.js
│   │   ├── App.test.js
│   │   └── index.js
│   └── webpack.config.js
└── README.md (this file)
```

- Each subdirectory has its own **README.md** with setup instructions, dependencies, and usage examples.
- The naming convention (`bracket-matcher`, `some-other-project`) indicates the feature or problem the project addresses.

## How to Use

1. **Explore a Subfolder**:  
   Check out its `README.md` for specific setup and usage instructions.
2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Typically `npm install` in the project folder.
3. **Run the Project**:  
   Use `npm start` (or a similar script) to launch a local dev server.
4. **Experiment & Extend**:  
   Feel free to modify or enhance the UI, add more features, or integrate additional algorithmic logic from the `leetcode-solutions` folder.

## Future Additions

- **Data Visualization Apps**: Graphically represent algorithms like BFS/DFS, dynamic programming, etc.
- **AI-Assisted UIs**: Integrate AI or chat-like interfaces to explain solutions or generate new test cases.
- **Framework Variety**: Possibly include Vue, Angular, or Svelte examples to broaden front-end experience.

## Contributing

- **Fork & Clone**: Create a new subfolder if you want to add another front-end project.
- **Pull Requests**: Submit improvements or new features for existing apps.  
- **Commit Style**: Use tags like `#frontend`, `#react`, or `#ui` to categorize commits.
