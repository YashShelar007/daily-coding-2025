# Cloud Integrations

Welcome to the **Cloud Integrations** section of the Daily Coding Challenge project. This folder is dedicated to showcasing how classic algorithm challenges can be seamlessly integrated into modern cloud-based solutions. 

## Overview

In this folder, you'll find projects that demonstrate:
- **Serverless Architectures:** Deploying solutions as AWS Lambda functions integrated with API Gateway.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Automating deployments with Terraform and CloudFormation.
- **Containerized Services:** Packaging applications with Docker and orchestrating them with Kubernetes.
- **Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Solutions:** Experimenting with services across different cloud providers.

Each project within this folder is organized into its own subdirectory, following a modular structure. This allows you to easily add new services or integrate different cloud technologies as your portfolio grows.

## Directory Structure

A typical project folder within **cloud-integrations** includes:
- **Lambda/Serverless Functions:** Code and configuration for deploying serverless functions.
- **Terraform/CloudFormation:** Infrastructure definitions for automating resource provisioning.
- **Additional Services:** As needed, for example, container orchestration or CI/CD configurations.

## Getting Started

1. **Explore a Project:**  
   Navigate to any subdirectory (e.g., `two-sum`) to see how a specific algorithm solution is deployed in the cloud.
   
2. **Deploy a Service:**  
   Follow the instructions in the project's README (each project folder contains its own README) to package and deploy the service.

3. **Extend & Experiment:**  
   Feel free to add new subdirectories as you integrate additional cloud services, such as setting up a microservice with Docker or experimenting with multi-cloud deployment strategies.

Happy integrating, and may your cloud solutions be as scalable as your code!
